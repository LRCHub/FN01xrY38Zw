[00:30.35] You think I'd leave your side, baby
[00:36.75] You know me better than that
[00:42.33] You think I'd leave you down
[00:44.59] When you're down on your knees
[00:50.74] I wouldn't do that
[00:56.79] 'Cause I'll tell you're right
[00:59.33] When you want
[01:05.83] 
[01:10.14] And if only
[01:11.98] You could see into me
[01:22.05] Oh, when you're cold
[01:27.53] I'll be there
[01:31.53] Hold you tight to me
[01:41.53] 
[01:36.38] When you're on the outside, baby
[01:38.75] And you can't get in
[01:41.35] I will show you
[01:43.88] You're so much better
[01:45.13] Than you know
[01:51.63] 
[01:48.61] When you're lost
[01:49.91] When you're alone
[01:51.45] When you can't get back again
[01:54.36] I will find you, darling
[01:57.72] And I will bring you home
[02:10.22] 
[02:03.22] And if you want to cry
[02:06.73] I am here to dry your eyes
[02:14.31] And in time
[02:17.57] You'll be fine
[02:24.57] 
[02:23.02] You think I'd leave your side, baby
[02:29.53] You know me better than that
[02:35.33] You think I'd leave you down
[02:37.59] When you're down on your knees
[02:43.75] I wouldn't do that
[02:50.49] I'll tell you're right
[02:52.84] When you want
[02:59.34] 
[03:03.69] And if only
[03:05.38] You could see into me
[03:15.78] Oh, when you're cold
[03:21.58] I'll be there
[03:24.60] Hold you tight to me
[03:34.60] 
[03:29.13] Oh, when you're low
[03:34.67] I'll be there
[03:37.66] By your side, baby
[03:42.36] Oh, when you're cold
[03:48.02] I'll be there
[03:51.04] Hold you tight to me
[04:01.04] 
[03:55.62] Oh, when you're low
[04:01.17] I'll be there
[04:04.02] By your side, baby
[04:08.25] Oh, when you're low
[04:13.99] I'll be there
[04:17.24] By your side
[04:23.24] 
[04:21.40] Oh, when you're low
[04:26.85] I'll be there
[04:29.96] By your side, baby
[04:34.31] Oh, when you're low
[04:39.88] I'll be there
[04:43.27] By your side, baby
